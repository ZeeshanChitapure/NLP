2.      The facts leading to the present appeal in nutshell are as under:-

1

2.1   A contract  was  entered  into  between  the appellant  and  the

respondents   regarding   the   earthwork   including   lining   of

V.U.G.C.   from   KM  10  to  KM  11   vide  agreement   dated 06.02.1988.  During  the  contract  
work,  various  disputes  and differences  arose  between  the  parties.      All  disputes  and 
differences between the parties were required to be resolved through   arbitration   in   pursuance 
  of   clause   52   of   the agreement.  Clause 52 of the agreement reads as under:-
“52. ARBITRATION:
All  disputes  or  differences  in  respect  of which  the  decision  is  not  final  and  
conclusive, shall be referred for arbitration to a sole arbitrator appointed as follows:
Within  thirty  days  of  receipt  of  notice  from  the contractor  of  his  intention  to  refer  
the  dispute  to arbitration  the  Chief  Engineer  shall  send  to  the contractor  a  list  of  
three  officers  of  the  rank  of Superintending Engineer  or higher, who have not been connected 
with the work under this contract. The contractor  shall within fifteen  days of  receipt of  this  
list  select  and  communicate  to  the  Chief Engineer the name of one officer from the list who 
shall then be appointed  as the sole  arbitrator.   If contractor  fails  to  communicate  his  
selection  of name,   within   the   stipulated   period,   the   Chief Engineer  shall  without  
delay  select  one  officer from   the   list   and   appoint   him   as   the   sole arbitrator.  
If the Chief Engineer  fails to send such a   list   within   thirty   days,   as   stipulated,   
the contractor  shall  send  a  similar  list  to  the  Chief
2

Engineer  within fifteen days.   The Chief  Engineer shall   then   select   an   officer   from  
the   list   and appoint  him  as  the  sole  arbitrator  within  fifteen days.    If  the  Chief  
Engineer  fails  to  do  so  the contractor    shall    communicate    to    the    Chief Engineer  
the  name  of  one  officer  from  the  list, who shall then be the sole arbitrator.
The arbitration  shall be conducted in accordance with  the  provisions  of  the  Indian  
Arbitration  Act, 1940  or  any  statutory  modification  thereof.   The decision  of  the  sole  
arbitrator  shall  be  final  and binding  on  the  parties  thereto.    The  arbitrator shall 
determine  the amount of costs of arbitration to be awarded to either parties.
Performance  under  the  contract  shall  continue during arbitration proceedings  and payments  
due to  the  contractor   by  the  owner   shall   not   be withheld, unless they are the subject 
matter of the arbitration proceedings.
All  awards   shall  be  in  writing   and  in  case  of awards amount to Rs.1.00 Lakh and above, 
such awards   shall   state   reasons   for   the   amounts awarded.
Neither   party   is   entitled   to   bring   a  claim   to arbitration  if  arbitrator  has  not  
been  appointed before  the  expiration  of  thirty  days  after  defect liability period.”


2.2    Arbitrator  was  required  to  be  appointed  as  provided  under clause  52  of  the  
agreement.  The  Chief  Engineer  appointed one  Shri  S.S. Manocha,  who  at the relevant  time 
was  also a Chief Engineer, as an Arbitrator vide order dated 31.10.1992.
3

The    Sole   Arbitrator    entered    into    the    Reference    on 19.11.1992 and issued notice 
to the parties directing them to submit the relevant papers and documents etc.  The claimant filed  
its  claim  giving  all  details.   The  respondents  also  filed their   objections   to   the   
said   claim   of   the   claimant.      The respondents,  thus, participated  in the proceedings 
before the
Sole Arbitrator.  On various dates, the arbitration proceedings were  adjourned  at the instance  
of  the  respondents.   During the    period,    the    learned    Arbitrator    Shri    S.S.    
Manocha superannuated   on  completion   of  superannuation  age  on
30.11.1995.    During  the  hearing,  the  time  for  making  and

publishing the award was extended  from time to time by the respondents.  That the Superintending 
Engineer vide its letter dated 09.08.1996  refused to extend the period of arbitration particularly 
 when  the  arbitration  was  about  to  close  and  the
same  could  not  be  completed  due  to  lapses,  default  and

seeking adjournments on the part of the respondents.

2.3     The appellant  thereafter  filed Arbitration  Suit No.116  of 1996 before   the  Civil  
Judge   (Senior   Division),   Roorkee   under Section  28 of the Arbitration Act, 1940 praying  
for extension of time for making the award and for hearing and conducting the  arbitration.    The  
respondents  took  their  objections  that
4

the  arbitrator  has  got  retired  and,  therefore,  the  arbitration proceedings  should  not  be 
 proceeded  further  by  the  Sole Arbitrator,  who  has  retired.   Even  the  respondents  also  
filed
Misc.   Suit   No.   122   of   1997   with   a   prayer   for   declaring

Reference   sent  to   the   Sole  Arbitrator   as   inoperative   and

illegal.

2.4    Both the suits were heard together by the learned Civil Judge (Senior    Division),    
Roorkee.        By    common    order    dated 11.12.1997,    the    learned    Civil    Judge    
(Senior    Division)
extended  the  period  of  arbitration  for  30  days  and  directed

the  Sole  Arbitrator,  Shri  S.S.  Manocha  to  decide  the  same within   the   extended   period 
  of   time.     That   thereafter,   the learned   Sole  Arbitrator,   Shri   S.S.   Manocha   
declared   the award  on  08.01.1998  and  ordered  the  respondents  to  pay  a total  sum  of  
Rs.10,97,024.00  with  interest  on  the  said  sum from  01.10.1990  to  07.01.1998.   The  
respondents  filed  their objections  under  Section  30/33  of  the  Arbitration  Act,  1940 vide  
Misc.  Case  No.  3  of  1998,  challenging  the  said  award and  made  prayer  therein  for  
setting  aside  the  award  dated
08.01.1998  before  the  learned  Civil  Judge  (Senior  Division), Roorkee.

5

2.5    Having  found  that  arbitration  clause  52  of  the  agreement does not provide for 
terminating the mandate of the Arbitrator on  his  retirement,  the  learned  Civil  Judge  (Senior 
 Division), Roorkee  overruled  the  objections  raised  by  the  respondents
herein  and  made  the  award  dated  08.01.1998  Rule  of  the

COUFt.
2.6    Feeling  aggrieved,  dissatisfied  with  the  judgment  and  order dated 20.04.2001 passed 
by the learned Civil Judge (Senior Division),  Roorkee,  overruling/rejecting the  objections  of  
the respondents  and  making  the  award  dated  08.01.1998  Rule of  the  Court,  the  respondents 
 preferred  appeal  before  the High  Court  and  by impugned  judgment  and  order  the  High 
Court has  allowed  the said appeal and has  quashed  and set
aside   the   award   dated   08.01.1998   made   by   Shri   S.S. Manocha,  the  then  Chief  
Engineer  and  the  Sole  Arbitrator and  the  order  dated  20.04.2001  passed  by  the  learned  
Civil Judge  (Senior  Division),  Roorkee  making  the  award  Rule  of the  Court,  solely  and  
mainly  on  the  ground  that  after  the retirement of the Sole Arbitrator, Shri S.S. Manocha as 
Chief
Engineer,   he   has   misconducted   himself   by   proceeding further with the arbitration 
proceedings.

6

2.7    Feeling    aggrieved    and    dissatisfied    by    the    impugned judgment  and  order  
passed  by  the  High  Court,  the  original claimant has preferred the present appeal.
3.      Shri  Mukesh  Kumar  Sharma,  learned  Advocate  has  appeared  on behalf   of  the  
appellant  and  Shri  Ravindra  Raizada,  learned  Senior Advocate has appeared on behalf of the 
respondents — State of U.P.
4.      Shri  Mukesh   Kumar   Sharma,   learned  Advocate   appearing   on behalf  of  the  
appellant  has  vehemently  submitted  that  in the  facts  and circumstances   of  the  case,  the 
 High  Court  has  materially  erred  in quashing  and setting aside the award declared by the Sole 
Arbitrator  as well  as  the  order  passed  by  the  learned  Civil  Judge  (Senior  Division), 
Roorkee making the award Rule of the Court.
5.      It  is  submitted  that  both  the  parties  are  bound  by  the  arbitration clause 
contained in the agreement, in particularly, contained in clause 52 of  the  agreement.      It  is 
 submitted  that  clause  52  of  the  agreement provides for nomination of the arbitrator  by the 
Chief Engineer  out of the three officers of the rank of Superintending Engineer  or higher, who 
have not been connected with the work under the contract.  It is submitted that clause   52   does  
 not   provide   that   the   arbitrator   nominated   and/or appointed  shall have a mandate  to 
continue  the arbitration  proceedings till he remains in service, and, thereafter,  on his 
retirement  his mandate is terminated.   It is submitted that in absence  of such a provision in 
the
7

clause  52,  once  an Arbitrator  is appointed  considering  the  qualification mentioned in clause 
 52, thereafter,  he continues as an Arbitrator  till the arbitration  proceedings  are  concluded  
unless  clause  52  provides  other way  round.   It  is  further  submitted  by  learned  Advocate 
 appearing  on behalf of the appellant that even otherwise the High Court ought to have appreciated 
   that   throughout    the   respondents    participated   in   the arbitration proceedings even 
after the Sole Arbitrator, Shri S.S. Manocha attained the age of superannuation.  It is submitted 
that High Court has also not appreciated that even thereafter by order dated 11.12.1997, the 
learned  Civil  Judge  (Senior  Division),  Roorkee  extended  the  time  to complete   the  
arbitration   proceedings   after   overruling   the  objections raised  by  the  respondents   and 
 that  after  the  retirement,   Shri  S.S. Manocha, the learned Sole Arbitrator cannot continue 
with the arbitration proceedings.   It is submitted that the order  dated 11.12.1997  passed by the 
   learned    Civil    Judge    (Senior    Division),    Roorkee    remained unchallenged  and  
attained  the  finality.    It  is  submitted,  therefore,  that thereafter  it was not  open for  
the respondents  again to raise  the same objection  that  after   the  learned  Sole  Arbitrator,  
 Shri  S.S.  Manocha attained the age  of  superannuation on 30.11.1995,  he cannot  continue with  
the  arbitration   proceedings,   the  objection   which  as  such  was overruled/rejected by the 
learned Civil Judge (Senior  Division),  Roorkee while passing the order dated 11.12.1997.

6.      Making  the aforesaid  submissions  and relying  upon the decisions of this Court in 
Himalayan Construction  Co. Vs. Executive Engineer, Irrigation Division, J&K and Anr., (2001) 9 SCC 
359, Prasun Roy Vs. Calcutta  Metropolitan  Development  Authority  and  Anr.,  (1987)  4 SCC  217  
and  N. Chellappan  Vs. Secretary,  Kerala State  Electricity Board and Anr., (1975) 1 SCC 289, 
learned Advocate appearing for the appellant  prayed  to allow  the present  appeal  and  quash  
and set aside the  impugned   judgment   and  order   passed  by  the  High  Court  and 
consequently  to  restore  the  award  declared  by  the  Sole  Arbitrator  and the order  passed 
by the learned  Civil Judge (Senior  Division),  Roorkee making the award Rule of the Court.
7.      The  present  appeal  is  opposed  by  Shri  Raizada,  learned  Senior

Advocate appearing on behalf of the respondents.

8.      It   is   vehemently   submitted   by   Shri   Raizada,   learned   Senior Advocate 
appearing on behalf of the respondents that it is not in dispute that the learned Sole Arbitrator  
was appointed  as per  clause  52 and as he  was  the  Chief  Engineer.    It  is  submitted,  
therefore,  that  once  he retired on attaining the age of superannuation and he did not continue 
as a  Chief   Engineer,   his  mandate   is  terminated   to  continue   with  the arbitration  
proceedings  and  a  new  Arbitrator  is  to  be  nominated  and appointed  afresh  as  per  clause 
 52  of  the  agreement.    It  is  further submitted  that  right  from  the  retirement   of  the 
 Sole  Arbitrator,   the
9

respondents   raised   an   objection   against   his   continuing   with   the arbitration  
proceedings  and  despite  the  same,  he  continued  with  the arbitration proceedings  even after 
his retirement,  as rightly observed  by the High  Court,  he has misconducted  himself,  and,  
therefore,  the High Court has rightly quashed and set aside the award declared by Shri S.S. 
Manocha,   the   learned   Sole  Arbitrator,   who   is   held   to   have   been misconducted.
9.      Shri  Raizada,  learned  Senior  Advocate  has  also  heavily  relied

upon the State Amendment  of Section  4 of the Arbitration Act, 1940 by submitting  that  as  per  
the  State Amendment  applicable  to  the  State  of U.P., in every case, where any appointed 
arbitrator neglects or refuses to act,  or  becomes  incapable  of  acting  or  dies,  the  vacancy 
 shall  be supplied  by  the  person  designated  as  mentioned  in  sub-section  (1)  of Section 
4.  Making the aforesaid submissions, it is prayed to dismiss the present appeal.
10.    Heard the learned counsel  appearing  for  the respective  parties at length.   The short 
question  which is posed for consideration  before this Court is whether  once  an officer  of the 
department  is appointed  as an Arbitrator  considering  the  arbitration  clause,  whether  his  
mandate  to continue   the  arbitration   proceedings   shall  come  to  an  end  on  his 
retirement?  The further question which is posed is whether continuance


10

of  the  arbitration  proceedings  by such an Arbitrator  after  his  retirement can be said to be 
committing a misconduct by such a Sole Arbitrator?
11.     For the aforesaid question,  the relevant arbitration  clause required

to   be   considered   is   clause   52.      In   the   present   case,   arbitration agreement   
contains   arbitration   clause   as   per   clause   52   of   the agreement,  which  is  
reproduced  hereinabove.  It  provides  that  on  the receipt  of  the  notice  from  the  
contractor   of  his  intention  to  refer  the dispute to the arbitration the Chief Engineer  
shall send to the contractor
a list of three  officers  of  the rank of  Superintending Engineer  or  higher, who   have   not   
been   connected   with   the   work   under   the   contract. Thereafter,  the  contractor  shall  
within  fifteen  days  of  receipt  of  the  list select  and communicate  to the Chief  Engineer  
the name  of  one  officer from  the  list,  who  shall  then  be  appointed  as  the  Sole  
Arbitrator.    It further provides that if a contractor is failed to communicate his selection
of  name,  within  the  stipulated  period,  the  Chief  Engineer  shall  without delay   select   
one   officer   from   the   list  and   appoint   him   as   the   Sole Arbitrator.   It further 
provides that if the Chief Engineer fails to send such a  list within 30 days,  as  stipulated,  
the contractor  shall send a similar  list to  the  Chief  Engineer  within  fifteen  days  and  
the  Chief  Engineer  shall then select an officer  from the list and appoint  him as  the Sole 
Arbitrator within  fifteen  days.    It  further  provides  that  the  arbitration  shall  be 
conducted  in accordance with the provisions of the Indian Arbitration Act,
11

1940.    Therefore,  the only qualification  for appointment  as an arbitrator is  that  he  should 
 be  the  officer  of  the  rank  of  the  Superintending Engineer   or   higher.     Once  such  
an  officer   is   appointed   as  an Arbitrator,  he continues  to be the Sole Arbitrator  till 
the arbitration proceedings  are  concluded  unless  he  incurs  the  disqualification under the 
provisions  of the Indian Arbitration Act, 1940.   Even after his retirement,  the arbitration  
proceedings  have  to be continued  by the same Arbitrator.  Clause 52 of the agreement does not 
provide at all that on  the  retirement   of  such  an  officer,  who  is  appointed  as  a  Sole 
Arbitrator,  he shall not continue  as a Sole Arbitrator  and/or the mandate to continue with the 
arbitration proceedings will come to an end.
12.    Identical question came to be considered by this Court in the case of  Himalayan  
Construction  Co.  (supra).    The  question  before  this Court  was  whether  the High  Court  
was  justified  in taking  the  view that the  award,  which  is made  the  Rule  of  the  Court  
by the  learned  Single Judge  was  illegal  and  liable  to  be  set  aside  on  the  ground  that 
 the arbitrator, who was appointed by designation had retired and has ceased to hold his office 
when he passed the award.  In that case also, the Sole Arbitrator  even after his retirement  
prayed for extension of time and the extension was granted after hearing the parties and as no such 
objection was raised at that time, and thereafter the nominated Arbitrator, who was the  officer,  
passed  the  award.   This  Court  overruled  the  objection  that
12

after   the  retirement   of   the  Sole  Arbitrator,   who  was   appointed   by designation  
cannot  continue  arbitration  proceedings  after  his retirement and cannot pass the award.
13.    In  the  present  case  also  the  Sole  Arbitrator,  who  at  the  relevant time  was  the  
Chief  Engineer  and  was  qualified  to  become  the  Sole Arbitrator  was even nominated  and/or  
appointed  by the Chief  Engineer as  per  clause  52.    Therefore,  considering  the  clause  52  
of  the agreement,  it  cannot be said that his mandate to continue with the arbitration 
proceedings would come to an end on his retirement.
14.    It is further  required  to be noted that even the very objection  was raised   by  the  
respondents   before   the   learned   Civil   Judge   (Senior Division),  Roorkee  when  the  
question  of  extension  of  time  was  being considered  by the learned Civil Judge (Senior  
Division),  Roorkee.   The learned   Civil   Judge   (Senior   Division),   Roorkee   overruled   
such   an objection   and   granted   further   one   month's   extension   to   the   Sole 
Arbitrator  to  complete  the  arbitration  proceedings.   The  said  order  has attained  the  
finality.    Therefore,   thereafter,  it  was  not  open  for  the respondents to again raise such 
an objection.
15.    Now, so far as the reliance placed upon the amendment to Section 4 of the Indian Arbitration 
Act, 1940 as applicable to the State of U.P. is concerned,   the  aforesaid  has  no  substance.    
 State  amendment   of

13

Section  4  of  Arbitration  Act,  1940  as  applicable  to  State  of  U.P.  upon

which the reliance has been placed reads as under:-
“ XXXXXXXXXX

(2)   In  every  such  case  where  any  appointed  arbitrator neglects  or  refuses  to  act,  or  
becomes  incapable  of acting  or  dies,  the  vacancy  shall  be  supplied  by  the person 
designated as aforesaid.”

On  fair  reading  of  the  aforesaid  provision,  we  are  afraid  that  the aforesaid  provision 
shall be applicable  at all.   It cannot be said that the Sole  Arbitrator  had  become  incapable  
of  acting  on  his  retirement  from service.

16.    Even  the  observations  made  by  the  High  Court  in  the  impugned judgment and order 
that the Sole Arbitrator has misconducted himself by continuing with the arbitration proceedings 
after his retirement is also not tenable  at  law.   In  the  present  case,  the  learned  Civil  
Judge  (Senior Division),  Roorkee  extended the time to the Sole Arbitrator  to complete the 
arbitration  proceedings  and granted  further  period of 30 days which was  after  his  retirement 
 and  after  specifically  overruling/rejecting  the objections  raised  by  the  respondents  that 
 after  retirement,  he  cannot continue  with the arbitration  proceedings.   Therefore,  once  
the  learned Sole Arbitrator continued with the arbitration proceedings and passed the


14

award  within  the  extended  period  of  time,  it cannot  be said that  he has misconducted 
himself as he continued with the arbitration proceedings.

17.     In   view   of   the   above   and   for   the   reasons   stated   above,   the impugned  
judgment  and order  passed  by  the  High  Court  quashing  and setting  aside the award as well 
as the order passed by the learned  Civil Judge  (Senior  Division),  Roorkee  making  the  
impugned  award  Rule  of
the  Court  deserves  to  be  quashed  and  set  aside.    Accordingly,   the present  appeal  is  
allowed.   The  impugned  judgment  and  order  passed by the  High Court dated  19.06.2007  passed 
 in A.O.  No.1489  of  2001  is
quashed  and  set  aside  and  the  award  passed  by  the  learned  Sole
Arbitrator  dated  08.01.1998  and  the  order  passed  by  the  learned  Civil Judge  (Senior  
Division),  Roorkee  dated  20.04.2001  passed  in  Original Suit No. 4 of 1998 and Misc.  Suit 
No.3 of 1998 making  the award,  Rule of the Court are hereby restored.
18.     In the facts and circumstances  of the case, there shall be no order
as to costs.
