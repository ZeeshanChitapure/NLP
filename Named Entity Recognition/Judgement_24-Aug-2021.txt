B.Com and looking  after  the domestic  works;  that since  her  husband  was  unemployed  and  it  
was  difficult  to  maintain  the family expenses,  at that time, one Vela alias Velayutham was 
introduced by  respondent   no.1   herein   and   told   them   that   the   said  Vela  alias 
Velayutham  is  employed    at  Guindy  Employment  Exchange  and  that  if

came to know that her husband died at the spot of the incident itself; that  it  was  alleged  that 
 the  powder  given  by  Velayutham-A1  was  the cause for her husband's death and her drowsiness; 
that the statement of the complainant was recorded at the hospital on 24.09.2019 which at the 
relevant  time  was treated  as dying  declaration.   The  relevant  extract  of the same is as 
under:
“My name is Saranya I studied B.Com, I got married, my husband name is Karthick,  I  am  having  
two  sons,  I  am  a  house  wife,  my  husband  was professor  and due to non-payment  of salary,

Nagar. Previously  I  went  to  guindy  office,  velayutham  asked  as  to  come  in  the lane,

 to  me  and  my  husband  yellow colour  cover  in  spoon,  immediately  velayutham  took  the  
mobile  of  her husband and went in two wheeler  for taking Xerox copy of the order copy. My   
husband   took   the   prasadam   and   felt   something   irritation   and immediately  took  the 
water  and spit the  same,  and also  he give water  to his wife with instruction  to spit the 
content in her mouth,  she also spit the content,  my husband  suffered  fits and he closed  his 
eyes,  I  do not  know

something  to my husband  and killed him,  Bharathi is  also  the  cause.  Enquiry  completed  at  
02.55  afternoon.  The  Patient conscious and able to speak till completing the declaration."


2.1    That  the  dying  declaration  was  recorded  by the  Magistrate  in the presence of Doctor 
who certified that the patient was conscious and able to  speak;  that  it  was  the  specific  
case  on  behalf  of  the  appellant- complainant  that it was  the respondent  no.1 herein  — 
original  accused no.2 who introduced Vela @ Velayutham — A1 to them and she said that she   is  
working   in  the   Secretariat   and  that   there   is  a  job  in  the employment office and for 
arranging the same, Rs. 6 lakhs may be given and  relying  upon  her  statement  Rs.  5  lakhs  was 
 given;  that  thereafter after  the  investigation   the  investigating   officer  filed  the  
chargesheet against  Vela @  Velayutham  — A1 for  the  offences  under  Sections  326, 307, 302, 
420 r/w 34 IPC and against  respondent  no.1 herein — A2 for the offences under Sections 420, 302 
r/w Section 109 IPC; that the case was pending for committal before the learned X Metropolitan

the entire chargesheet as against her, pending  committal  in P.R.C.  No. 250 of 2019 on the file 
of the  learned  X  Metropolitan  Magistrate,  Egmore,  Chennai;  that  by  the impugned  judgment  
and  order,  the  High  Court  in  exercise  of  powers
4

the criminal  proceedings  qua respondent  no.1 herein- A2 in P.R.C.  No.  250 of  2019  on the  
file of  the  learned  X  Metropolitan Magistrate,  Egmore,  Chennai  for  the offences  under  
Sections  420, 302 r/w 109 IPC.
3.      Feeling  aggrieved  and  dissatisfied  with  the  impugned  judgment and  order  passed  by 
 the  High  Court  quashing  and  setting  aside  the entire criminal proceedings/chargesheet qua 
respondent  no.1 herein-A2 in  P.R.C.  No.  250  of  2019  on  the  file  of  the  learned  X  
Metropolitan Magistrate,  Egmore,  Chennai  for  the offences  under  Sections  420, 302 r/w 109 
IPC, the original complainant — victim — wife of the deceased has preferred the present appeal.
4.      Shri G.S. Mani, learned Advocate  has appeared  for the appellant, Shri S. Nagamuthu,  
learned Senior Advocate has appeared on behalf of respondent  no.1 herein  — original  accused  
no.2  and  Shri  (Dr.)  Joseph Aristotle S, learned Advocate has appeared on behalf of the 
respondent
— State of Tamil Nadu.

4.1   Shri Mani, learned Advocate  appearing  on behalf  of the appellant has  vehemently  
submitted  that  in  the  facts  and  circumstances  of  the case,  the  High  Court  has  
committed  a  grave  error  in  quashing  and setting aside the entire criminal proceedings qua 
respondent no.1 herein
5

for  the  offences  under  Sections  420,  302  r/w  109  IPC,  in  exercise  of
powers under Section 482 Cr.P.C.

4.2     It  is   submitted  that  despite  the  fact  that  there  is  ample  material against  
respondent  no.1  herein — original  accused  no.2,  the  High  Court has  quashed  the  entire  
criminal  proceedings/chargesheet  by  entering
into  the  merits  of  the  allegations   and  appreciating  the  evidence  on record,  which  at  
this  stage  and  while  considering  the  application  under Section 482 Cr.P.C. is not 
permissible.
4.3     It is  submitted that the High Court has  not properly  appreciated  the fact that as such 
it was respondent  no.1 herein — original  accused no.2 who assured  and/or  given promise  that 
she will arrange  for the job and
for that she demanded the money.

4.4     It  is  submitted   that  as  such  respondent  no.1  herein  —  original accused  no.2  
introduced  Vela  @  Velayutham  — A1  to  the  complainant and her husband  and an amount of Rs. 5 
lakhs were given to A1.   It is
submitted  that the High Court has not properly appreciated  the fact that as such  there  was  
confessional  statement  of  respondent  no.1  herein  — A2  and  on  the  basis  of  the  said  
confessional  statement,  there  was  a recovery  of  Rs.   1 lakh 20  thousand  from  the  house  
of  respondent  no.1
herein — original accused no.2.



6

4.5    It  is  further  submitted  that  during  the  course  of  the  investigation, the  
investigating  officer  also  collected  the  evidence  in  the  form  of  call details,  more  
particularly  the calls  between  A1 & A2 in the proximity  of the time of commission of offence.
4.6    It  is  submitted  that  despite  the  above  material  collected  and  the circumstances,   
 the    High    Court    has    erroneously    quashed    the chargesheet/entire  criminal  
proceedings  qua  respondent  no.1 herein  — original accused no.2, in exercise of powers under 
Section 482 Cr.P.C.
4.7    It is submitted that while  quashing  the chargesheet/entire criminal proceedings,  the  
High  Court  has  evidently  ignored  what  has  emerged during the course of investigation.  The 
High Court has not at all applied the relevant test, namely,  when there is sufficient ground for 
proceeding against  the  accused  or  whether  there  is  ground  for  presuming  that accused has 
committed the offence.   It is submitted  that the High Court has exceeded  in its jurisdiction  to 
quash the chargesheet/entire criminal proceedings  in  exercise  of  powers  under  Section  482  
Cr.P.C.    Heavy reliance  is placed  on the  decision  of  this  Court  in the case  of  State  of 
Madhya Pradesh v. Deepak, reported in (2019) 13 SCC 62.
4.8    Making  the  above  submissions,  it  is  prayed  to  allow  the  present appeal  and  quash 
 and  set  aside  the  impugned  judgment  and  order passed    by    the    High    Court    
quashing    and    setting    aside    the
7

chargesheet/entire  criminal  proceedings  qua  respondent  no.1 herein  — original accused no.2 
for the offences under  Sections  420, 302 r/w 109 IPC.
5.      Dr.  Joseph  Aristotle  S,  learned  Advocate  appearing  on  behalf  of the State of Tamil 
Nadu has supported the appellant.  Reliance is placed on  the  counter  affidavit  filed  on  
behalf  of  respondent  no.2  —  State  of Tamil Nadu.
5.1   It is vehemently  submitted  that as such  during  the course  of  the investigation, the 
investigating  officer  collected  ample  material/evidence against both the accused and only 
thereafter chargesheet has been filed against  A1 for  the  offences  under  Sections  326,  307,  
302,  420,  r/w 34 IPC  and for  the offences  under  Sections  420, 302 r/w 109 IPC  against 
respondent no.1 herein — original accused no.2.
5.2    It   is   vehemently   submitted   that   during   the   course   of   the investigation,  
the  investigating   officer   has  collected   the  call   details between A1 and A2.  It is 
submitted that perusal of the call details report furnished by the service provider and the nodal 
officer clearly proves that there  were  several  calls  made  by  both  A1  and  A2,  vice  versa, 
 for example  on  23.09.2019  (the  day  when  the  incident  had  occurred)  at about 09:05:26, 
respondent  no.1 herein  — A2 made  a call to A1 on his mobile No. 9790846016  from her mobile No. 
6382028209  and again A1
8

had  made  a  call  to  A2  —  respondent  no.1  herein  on  the  same  day  at about 09:51:59  and 
09:55:15.   It is submitted  that it clearly shows that at that time A1 was available at the place 
of the incident and for second call also tower location showed the same place.  It is submitted 
that again on the same day from mobile No. 9790846016, A1 made a call to A2 on her mobile no. 
6382028209 at about 6:36 p.m.  It is submitted that therefore it  is  clearly  established  that  
the  said  Mrs.  Bharathi,  respondent  no.1 herein — A2 aided and instigated the offence committed 
by A1.
5.3     It  is  further  submitted  that  there  was  a  recovery  of  Rs.   1  lakh  20 thousand  
from  the  house  of  A2  at  the  instance  of  A2.   It  is  submitted therefore  that  the  High 
 Court  has  exceeded  in  its  jurisdiction  to  quash the chargesheet/entire criminal proceedings 
qua respondent no.1 herein,
while exercising the powers under Section 482 Cr.P.C.

6.      Shri Nagamuthu,  learned  Senior Advocate  appearing  on behalf  of respondent   no.1   
herein   —  A2   has   submitted   that   in   the   facts   and circumstances  of  the  case  and  
considering  the  material/evidence  on
record   and   having   found   that   there   is   not   even   a   prima   facie 
evidence/material against  respondent  no.1 herein  — A2, the  High  Court has    rightly    
quashed    the    chargesheet/criminal    proceedings    qua respondent no.1 herein in exercise of 
powers under Section 482 Cr.P.C. It is submitted  that as such  and  even considering  the 
statement  of  the
9

original  complainant   as  it  is  and  even  considering  the  case  of  the prosecution  as it 
is,  it cannot be said  that  respondent  no.1 herein — A2 has  committed  any  offence  under  
Sections  420,  302 r/w 109  IPC.   It is submitted   that   from   the   statement   of   the   
original   complainant   —
appellant,  it can be gathered  that the allegations  against A2 is that she introduced  A1  to  
them;  that  an amount  of  Rs.4/5  lakhs was  paid  to A1; that  the  allegations  of  giving  
poison  and  even  purchasing  of  poison  is against A1 only; that there is no evidence that at 
the time when A1 gave poison to the deceased, A2 — respondent no.1 herein was present.
6.1     It is further  submitted  that  the  so-called  confessional  statement  of

A2 is not admissible in the evidence at all and therefore no reliance can be  placed  upon  such  
alleged  confessional  statement,  which  has  no evidentiary value.
6.2     It is further submitted that even the so-called recovery of Rs.   1 lakh 20 thousand from 
the house of A2 cannot bring home the charge against A2  for  the  offences   for  which  she  has  
been  chargesheeted.    It  is
submitted  that  there  is  no  evidence  at  all  that  it  was  the  very  money

which was given to A1 by the complainant.

6.3     It is submitted  that even the so-called call details between A1 & A2 cannot  be said  to 
be a sufficient  material/evidence against A2.   Merely because A1 & A2 might have talked cannot be 
held against A2.
10

6.4    It is further  submitted  that even the statement  of  the complainant recorded  on  
24.09.2019  recorded  at the  hospital  cannot  be  treated  as dying  declaration  as  
subsequently  she  survived.    It  is  submitted  that there  is improvement  in the case  and 
subsequently  she  had come  out with  the  case  that  she  paid  Rs.  5  lakhs,  whereas  as  per 
 the  original case, an amount of Rs. 4 lakhs was given.
6.5    It  is  submitted  that  as  such  there  is  no  material/evidence  at  all against A2 for 
the offence under Section 109 IPC.  It is submitted that no case of appellant  attracting  the 
offence under  Section 109 IPC against respondent no.1 herein — A2 is made out.  It is submitted 
that there is no ingredient  available  as  against  A2  to  attract  the  offence  under  Section 
109 IPC.
6.6    It is submitted  therefore that in the facts and circumstances  of the case,  the  High  
Court  has  not  committed  any  error  in  quashing  and setting aside the chargesheet/criminal 
proceedings  qua accused no.2 in exercise of powers under Section 482 Cr.P.C.
6.7    Making the above submissions, it is prayed to dismiss the present appeal.
7.      We  have  heard  the  learned  counsel  for  the  respective  parties  at length.

11

Before   considering   the   rival   submissions   of   the   parties,   few decisions of this 
Court on the principles which the High Court must keep in mind while exercising the jurisdiction 
under Section 482 Cr.P.C./at the stage   of   framing   of   the   charge   while   considering   
the   discharge application are required to be referred to and considered.
7.1    In the case of Deepak (supra), to which one of us (Dr. Justice D.Y. Chandrachud)  is the 
author, after considering the other binding decisions of  this  Court  on  the  point,  namely,  
Amit  Kapoor  v.  Ramesh  Chander (2012)  9 SCC 460;  State  of  Rajasthan  v.  Fatehkaran  Mehdu  
(2017)  3 SCC 198; and Chitresh  Kumar Chopra v. State (Government  of NCT of Delhi) (2009) 16 SCC 
60lfi,  it is observed  and held that  at the stage  of framing  of  charges,  the  Court  has  to  
consider  the  material  only  with  a view  to find  out  if  there  is a ground  for  “presuming" 
 that  the  accused had committed  the offence.   It is observed  and held that  at that stage, the 
 High  Court  is  required  to  evaluate  the  material  and  documents  on record with a view to 
finding out if the facts emerging therefrom,  take at their face value, disclose the existence  of 
all the ingredients  constituting the alleged  offence  or  offences.   It is further  observed  
and held that  at this stage the High Court  is not required to appreciate  the evidence  on record 
and consider the allegations on merits and to find out on the basis



12

of  the evidence  recorded  the accused  chargesheeted  or against  whom

the charge is framed is likely to be convicted or not.

8.        In  the  present  case,  there  is  sufficient  material  on  record  raising the  strong 
 suspicion  against  respondent  no.1  herein  — A2  also.   It  has been  found  that  A2-  
respondent  no.1  herein  who  was  serving   in  the Secretariat  and was in touch with the 
deceased  and the complainant  as
she  used   to  go  to   Xerox   shop   owned   by  the   deceased   and  she introduced  A1  to  
the  complainant  and  the  deceased.    It  is  specifically alleged that she said that she can 
manage  to get the job/employment for the deceased but for that they have to pay.   It is  true 
that as  per the case
of the prosecution  and even as  per the statement of the complainant,  an

amount of Rs. 5 lakhs was paid to A1.  However, during the course of the investigation, an amount 
of Rs. 1 lakh 20 thousand has been recovered from  the  house  of  respondent  no.1  herein  —  A2  
at  the  instance  of  A2
herself.     It  may  be  true  that  the  so-called  confessional  statement  of
respondent  no.1 herein is inadmissible  in evidence.   However,  it is to be noted that on the 
basis of such statement,  there was a recovery of Rs.   1 lakh 20  thousand  from  the house  of A2 
— respondent  no.1  herein.   The other  aspect  whether  the  recovered  amount  of  Rs.   1  lakh 
 20  thousand
was  the  same  amount  which  was  given  by  the  deceased   and  the complainant  to A1 is a 
matter  of  evidence  to be considered  during trial.

13

Even the source of Rs. 1Iakh 20 thousand might have to be explained by

the accused.

9.      It  also  appears  that  during  the  course  of  the  investigation,  the investigating  
officer has collected very important evidence in the form of call  details  between  A1  & A2  
which  are  in  the  proximity  of  the  time  of commission  of  offence  and  even  thereafter.   
Therefore,  in the  facts  and
circumstances   of  the  case,   when  respondent   no.1  herein   has  been

chargesheeted  for  the  offences  under  Sections  420,  302  r/w  109  IPC and  as  observed  
hereinabove  when  there  is  ample  material  to  show  at least  a  prima  facie  case  against  
respondent  no.1  herein — A2,  the  High Court  has  committed  a grave  error  in  quashing  the  
chargesheet/entire criminal  proceedings  qua her  in exercise  of  powers  under  Section  482 
Cr.P.C.   Quashing  the  chargesheet  against  the  accused  is not  justified. The  High  Court  
has  evidently  ignored  what  has  emerged  during  the course    of    investigation.       The   
 High    Court    has    entered    into    the appreciation  of the evidence  and considered 
whether  on the basis of the evidence,  the  accused  is  likely  to  be  convicted  or  not,  
which  as  such  is
not  permissible  at  all  at  this  stage  while  considering  the  application under  Section 482 
Cr.P.C.   The High Court was not as such conducting the trial and/or  was not exercising  the  
jurisdiction  as an appellate  court against  the  order  of  conviction  or  acquittal.    
Therefore,  in  the  facts  and

14

circumstances  of  the  case,  the  High  Court  ought  not  to  have  quashed the chargesheet qua 
respondent no.1 herein — original accused no.2.
10.     In view of the above and for the reasons stated above, the present appeal  succeeds.    The 
 impugned  judgment  and  order  passed  by  the High  Court  quashing  the  chargesheet/criminal  
proceedings  in  P.R.C.
No.  250  of  2019  on  the  file  of  the  learned  Metropolitan   Magistrate,

Egmore, Chennai for the offences  under  Sections 420, 302 r/w 109 IPC qua  respondent  no.1 herein 
 —  original  accused  no.2  deserves  to  be quashed  and set aside  and is accordingly  quashed 
and set aside. Now the  learned  Magistrate  to proceed  further  with the case,  in accordance 
with  law.    It  goes  without  saying  that  any  observations  made  by  this
Court  in  the  present  order  shall  be  confined  to  while  considering  the

application  under  Section 482 Cr.P.C. and the trial in the aforesaid  case shall  proceed
